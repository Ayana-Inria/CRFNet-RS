## :gear: Installation

The code was built on a virtual environment running on Python 3.9

### Step :one:: Clone the repository

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ayana-Inria/CRFNet-RS.git
```

### Step :two:: Install the dependencies

```
cd CRFNet-RS

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step :three:: Run the code

1. Train the model on a scarce GT set 

```
python main.py -r -g conncomp
```
2. Infer on data

```
python main.py -g full
```


## :hammer: Project structure

```
semantic_segmentation
├── dataset - contains the data loader
├── input - images to train and test the network 
├── net - contains the loss, the network, and the training and testing functions
├── output - should contain the results of the training / inference
|   ├── exp_name
|   └── model.pth
├── utils - misc functions
└── main.py - program to run
```
  
## :toolbox: Data

The model is trained on the [ISPRS Vaihingen dataset](http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm3/wg4/2d-sem-label-vaihingen.html) and [ISPRS Potsdam dataset](http://www2.isprs.org/potsdam-2d-semantic-labeling.html). The two datasets consist of VHR optical images (spatial resolutions of 9 and 5cm, respectively), we used the IRRG channels. They can be downloaded on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bkfateam/potsdamvaihingen) and should be inserted in the folder `/input`.

The data should have the following structure. 

```
input
├── top
|   └── top_mosaic_09cm_area{}.tif
├── gt
|   └── top_mosaic_09cm_area{}.tif
└── gt_eroded
    └── top_mosaic_09cm_area{}_noBoundary.tif
```

### :pencil2: :straight_ruler: Reproduce the training data

To obtain the scarce ground truth, use the function `conn_comp(gt, kernel)` provided in `utils/utils_dataset.py` to be applied on the original fully labeled ground truth until the remaining label information is 30\% or 10\%.

### :receipt: Reproduce the evaluation results

You can download the weights of CRFNet for each dataset and ground truth condition, that produced the results published in the paper, from [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lUQ64GvajoYiQ8mrNQ2MUOpYD8sTdHhq?usp=sharing)

The model was trained with the following hyperparameters:

```
WINDOW_SIZE = (256, 256) # Patch size
STRIDE = 32 # Stride for testing
BATCH_SIZE = 10 # Number of samples in a mini-batch
base_lr = 0.01
weight_decay=0.0005
epochs = 30
```
